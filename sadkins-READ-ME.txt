L-System Improvisation Using Viola Pitch Detection
15-323 Final Project Spring 2016
Sara Adkins(sadkins)


**Installing the fiddle~ External**

In order to utilize the pitch detection aspect of this project, you will need 
the files fiddle~.mxe and fiddle~.help that are included in the fiddle~ 
directory. Note that for this external to function, you must run the project in 
Max 7 32-bit mode. Copy the file fiddle~.mxe and paste it into the 
resouces/externals/msp folder of Max 7. Copy the file fiddle~.help into the 
resources/help/msp folder. Upon restarting Max 7, fiddle~ should now be 
recognized as an object.


**Running the Program**

Once you have installed the fiddle~ external, open ViolaProject.maxpat to use 
the program. Ensure that your preferred audio input and output devices are set 
under the Options -> Audio Status menu. Once this is set up correctly, you can 
lock the patch and click on the blue buttons to begin detecting pitch and 
playing the L-system harmony. Be sure to djust the gain sliders in the main 
patch and in the sinusoid subpatches to your preferred levels. Note that when 
the gain sliders in the main patch are at zero, you will hear no audio.


**Using the Program**

Once the program is running, you can begin playing the viola. As long as your 
pitches are below C4, the L-system will play notes in the key of E-major, and 
you will hear the sinusoid drone playing a low E. To keep in key with the 
harmonies, it is recommended that you play notes primarily in the key of 
E-major, and add chromaticism as you see fit. When you play pitches from C4 to 
C5(not inclusive) the program will switch to a new L-system, where the rules 
contain notes in the key on A minor, and the drone sinusoid is a low A. Pitches 
C5 and above will invoke an L-system in the key of C major, with a low C drone 
sinusoid. Note that when you are not playing, the program will default to the E 
major L-system and sinusoid.

These three keys were chosen because they relate to each other in a minor 
tonic(A), dominant(E) and relative major(C) relationship. This is helpful to 
keep in mind as you think about how to effectively split up an improvization 
into sections. Though the sections are separated by the pitch class C, you may 
find it pleasing to begin new sections on the tonic of each key. For instance, 
jumping up to an A4 when you transition from the E-major section to the A-minor 
section to establish a strong sense of tonic. Also experiment with transitioning
on notes that are common to both keys, such as the C5(which is a member of the 
A minor and the C major scale), when jumping from the A minor section to the C 
major section. Also, when deciding when to switch to a different section, be 
sure to listen to the L-system for a transition time in the counter melody 
that you feel will be natural.


**L-system Grammar Details**
Grammars were kept to short rules so that each L-system has the opportunity to 
span out to many levels during the course of an improvisation so that 
interesting patterns may be formed. Each L-system is intentionally running 
continuosly throughout the piece(even though only one is ever playing notes 
at any given time, they are all always generating notes) so that as the piece 
progresses all of the L-systems become more and more dense and "fanned out".

E-major(Triggered by pitches below C4)
Axiom(First played sequence): E, F#
Grammar Rules:
E -> F#, G#
F# -> G#, B
G# -> E, F#
A -> B, G#
B -> A, E

A-minor(Triggered by pitches between C4 and C5)
Axiom: E, A
Grammar Rules:
A -> B, C
B -> E, A
C -> B, A
D -> E, F
E -> D, C
F -> A, E

C-major(Triggered by pitches C5 and above)
Axiom: C, E
Grammar Rules:
C -> D, G
D -> C, E
E -> D, F
F -> G, E
G -> D, C


**FM Synthesis of Generated Tones**
Then sinusoidal drones that play the tonic of each section are each made up of 
4 sinusoids: the fundamental frequency and the first 3 harmonics in the harmonic
series. The user is able to adjust the level of each of these sinusoids to 
create a timbre that is to their liking. A varying frequency modulation(the 
modulation index oscillates between 20 and 100Hz) is then applied to each 
sinusoid to create a "pulsating" effect in the drone.

The notes played from the L-system are simple sinusoids that are modulated by a 
low index of modulation to create a vibrato effect. Each note is then multiplied
by an envelope to create a staccato sound for the L-system harmony.
